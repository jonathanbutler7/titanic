# experiments with machine learning models

i am trying to get AI to teach me how to build machine learning models

the titanic project is a kaggle project that i followed a youtube tutorial for.

the airline tweets project is one that i got from a colleague as a small-ish scope exercise

i am becoming more familiar with how machine learning works. it's probably good that i've started with two smaller models
